# Etch-A-Sketch
This is the Odin Project based Etch-A-Sketch project.

## Introduction
The original goal for this project was to create a 16 X 16 grid of squares that will change color with a mouseover. 

## Process
I ended up using a combination of JS and CSS grid to eventually create the grid dynamically. This was after several attempts at using flexbox alone to perform this task. After numerous attempts and a deep dive into some CSS grid documentation I was able to get the result I wanted.
